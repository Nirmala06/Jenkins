Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice from Extreme Programming that requires developers to integrate code into a mainline as often as possible, at least once a day, and each check-in is then verified by an automated build that compiles the code and run the suite of automated tests against it, allowing teams to detect problems early.

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types; including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

In continuous deployment, the deployment
to production is automatically triggered for every change that passes the test suite.

Jenkins is a leading open source CI server written in Java. It provides hundreds
of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project. As Jenkins is
a CI server, its main purpose is to run automated tests on every new commit
that emerges in the remote repository mainline.
